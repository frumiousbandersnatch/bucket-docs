*(Rescued from [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170228183648/http://wiki.xkcd.com/wirc/index.php?title=Bucket&action=edit][archive.org]] and [[https://github.com/frumiousbandersnatch/bucket-docs][converted]] to Emacs org mode and then to [[https://frumiousbandersnatch.github.io/bucket-docs/][HTML]])*

Bucket has an outer shell of metal; within the metal is a protective
layer of high density plastic, in which may or may not reside pure HOH.
There can only be speculation about what else the Bucket contains.

* Using the #XKCD Bucket
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: using-the-xkcd-bucket
  :END:

1. Do not make our Bucket stupid or mean. Any stupiding of the Bucket
   may cause an op to tell Bucket to ignore you.
2. Bucket's replies should generally not be meaner or more asshole-y
   than the lines that trigger them.
3. +Do not alter factoids that are not your own.+ Nobody owns any
   factoids.
4. Only the ops are allowed to cull stupid or useless factoids. And they
   will, boy howdy they will. The only exception to this rule is if the
   factoid is about you -- if someone writes an abusive factoid about
   you and the ops have not corrected it, please feel free to edit it
   yourself.
5. Using Bucket as a surrogate asshole will result in either a
   revocation of your Bucket privileges or having your ass kicked from
   here to Pakistan (unless you live in Pakistan, in which case you will
   be booted to occupied North Texas). *Making abusive, mean factoids
   about anyone else is strictly outlawed* and if you are caught doing
   it, you will be harshly dealt with. Please tattle on anyone you see
   adding abusive factoids, whether in #xkcd or #bucket.
6. Do not attempt to have Bucket trigger another #xkcd bot. It won't
   work, don't try, you'll just really annoy those who have to clean up
   your mess. Do it enough and actions will be taken to correct the
   situation.
7. Do not try to put a variable in a factoid trigger. It does not work
   that way.

** Addressing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: addressing
   :END:

You need to address Bucket directly to teach him factoids; you can do so
by prefixing your message =Bucket,= or =Bucket:= (Your IRC client may
automatically do this).

*** If Bucket doesn't reply
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: if-bucket-doesnt-reply
    :END:

- Make sure you're prefixing messages properly. =Bucket~ [command]= and
  =Bucket [command]= will not trigger him.
- Bucket will not trigger non-addressed factoids which are shorter than
  6 letters long. =Bucket, dogs= will trigger bucket. =Dogs= on its own
  line will not. =Bucket, how2love= and =how2love= will trigger the same
  factoid.
- In PM, do not preface your commands with =Bucket, =, just use the
  =[command]= directly. You can only query, you cannot teach factoids in
  PM.
- Bucket might be shut up at the time. Use #bucket (or configured control channel) or PM to check.
- Bucket might be ignoring you -- and only you -- because an op has told
  it to. Probably because you put in some bad factoids.

** Teaching factoids to Bucket
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: teaching-factoids-to-bucket
   :END:

**** X is Y
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: x-is-y
     :END:

The most common type of factoid you can teach to Bucket is by simply
saying =X is Y=. If someone says "X" later on, Bucket will reply =X is Y=

- Be careful about accidentally creating a new factoid while talking
  to Bucket.  
- You can also say =X is also Y=, this was formerly required to attach
  multiple factoids to one trigger so you may see older users use
  this.
- If you type =X is Y is Z=, Bucket will split it on the first =is=,
  making the trigger =X= and the factoid =Y is Z= and Bucket will
  respond =X is Y is Z=.
- If you wanted =X is Y= to trigger =Z=, teach Bucket =X is Y <is> Z=.
  See more ways to verb.

**** X are Y
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: x-are-y
     :END:

Similar to =X is Y=, you can teach this kind of factoid by simply saying
=X are Y= and if someone says =X= later on, Bucket will reply =X are Y=

**** X <verb> Y
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: x-y
     :END:

You can use other things instead of =is= or =are= by putting them inside
greater and lesser-than signs, such as =X <loves> Y= or =X <compliments> Y=


**** X <reply> Y
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: x-y-1
     :END:

You can say =X <reply> Y=, when someone says =X=, Bucket will respond =Y=.

- You might see some people using =X is <reply> Y=, this was formerly
  required so you may see older users use it.

**** X <action> Y
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: x-y-2
     :END:

If you use =X <action> Y=, when someone says =X=, Bucket will use =/me Y=.

- Like the above two types, retain the greater-than and lesser-than signs.

**** Slash commands
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: slash-commands
     :END:

Bucket is not run on a client; she is her own entity. This means that
slash commands (things like =/me=, =/msg=, =/quit=, etc) *do not work*. *Do
not put them in*, you'll only anger those who have to clean up your
mess.

- Also, escaping (using the =\= to get things like question marks to
  go in on a factoid) is no longer needed.

**** Remember quote
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: remember-quote
     :END:

If you type =remember {nick} {snippet}= where ={snippet}= is a snippet
from a line that has been said by the person in ={nick}=, Bucket will
remember that factoid under the trigger ={nick} quotes=. When that quote
factoid is triggered, Bucket will respond =<Example> Lorem Ipsum=

- When Bucket is remembering a =/me= action, instead of the regular
  =<Example> Lorem Ipsum= he'll make an action =* Example lorem ipsumed=.

** Searching for factoids
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: searching-for-factoids
   :END:

**** Listing factoids
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: listing-factoids
     :END:

Teh =literal X= command will give you a list of factoids associated with that
trigger separated with =|=. If the list of factoids is too large, Bucket
will put them them on another "page" and indicate how many factoids are
on the subsequent pages by appending something like =72 more= on the
list of factoids. You can browse the next pages by using =literal[2] X=,
replacing =2= with the number of the page you wish to check.

**** List factoids in a text file
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: list-factoids-in-a-text-file
     :END:

Typing =literal[*] X= will make Bucket produce a url linking to a text
file of all the factoids associated with that trigger.

**** Triggering a specific factoid
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: triggering-a-specific-factoid
     :END:

=X =~ /m/= will make Bucket reply with the first factoid in that trigger
which contains =m=.

**** Listing the details of a factoid
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: listing-the-details-of-a-factoid
     :END:

=what was that?= will make Bucket list the factoid's details thusly:
=That was X(#77777): <reply> Y=, the number being the factoid's ID.

** Editing factoids
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: editing-factoids
   :END:

**** Substitution editing
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: substitution-editing
     :END:

Telling Bucket =X =~ s/m/n/= will replace =m= with =n= in the factoids
for the trigger =X=. Adding an =i= flag as in =X =~ s/m/n/i= replaces
case-insensitively. If there are multiple occurrences of =m=, Bucket
will edit the first instance in the trigger's first matching factoid.
Ops can add a =g= flag to replace all occurrences.

Slashes should not be backslash-escaped in the string--use any other
delimiter, such as a comma, as a replacement for slashes. Example: to
change =The best site <is> http://google.com/search= to =The best site <is> http://xkcd.com=, 
you could type: =Bucket: The best site =~ s,http://google.com/search,http://xkcd.com=

**** Undo
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: undo
     :END:

=undo last= undoes the last change made to a factoid (editing one,
adding one, deleting one.) Non-ops can undo last only if they made the
last change.

** Word class variable
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: word-class-variable
   :END:

Putting a word class variable in a factoid will replace the variable
with a word from the appropriate word class. Variables apply only to
Bucket's responses. For example, telling bucket =play with $who <reply> what would you like me to play with $who?= will not work.

**** $noun
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: noun
     :END:

Use =$noun= to place a noun variable which will become a noun when the
factoid is triggered.  Bucket knows plurals and will properly work
if you use =a $noun= or =some $nouns=.

**** $verb
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: verb
     :END:

Use =$verb= to place a verb variable which will become a verb when the
factoid is triggered.  Bucket knows plurals and tenses so =$verbs=,
=$verbed= and =$verbing= may be used.

**** $adjective
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: adjective
     :END:

Use =$adjective= to place an adjective variable which will become an
adjective when the factoid is triggered.

**** $preposition
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: preposition
     :END:

Use =$preposition= to place a proposition variable which will become a
preposition when the factoid is triggered.

** Username variables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: username-variables
   :END:

Putting a username variable in a factoid will replace the variable with
a username when triggered.

**** $who
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: who
     :END:

=$who= will be replaced by the name of the person who triggered the
factoid.

**** $someone
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: someone
     :END:

=$someone= will be replaced by a username chosen from recent posters.
Note, =$someone= used to be completely random, but was changed so that
Bucket doesn't bother idle users as much.

**** $to
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: to
     :END:

=$to= will be replaced by the intended recipient, e.g. =<Someone>
Bucket: yada yada= will replace =$to= with =Bucket=.  If there is no
intended recipient, it will fall back on =$someone=.

**** $op
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: op
     :END:

=$op= will be replaced by the name of one of the Ops.  Pro tip: annoy
ops at your own risk.

** Object variables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: object-variables
   :END:

**** $vehicle
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: vehicle
     :END:

=$vehicle= will be replaced with a vehicle.

**** $room
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: room
     :END:

=$room= will be replaced with a room.

**** $ejaculation
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: ejaculation
     :END:

=$ejaculation= will be replaced with a exclamation. /Support for this
feature is deprecated/

**** $celebrity
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: celebrity
     :END:

=$celebrity= will be replaced with a name of a celebrity.

**** $mood
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: mood
     :END:

=$mood= will be replaced with a name of a mood.

**** $color
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: color
     :END:

=$color= will be replaced with the name of a color.

**** $bodypart
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: bodypart
     :END:

=$bodypart= will be replaced with a (probably not scientific) name of a
body part.

** Number variables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: number-variables
   :END:

**** $digit
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: digit
     :END:

=$digit= will be replaced with a random digit from 0 to 9.

=$nonzero= will be replaced with a random digit from 1 to 9.

** Inventory
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: inventory
   :END:

Bucket uses the new RFC inventory system. 

*** Listing Bucket's inventory
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: listing-buckets-inventory
    :END:

Address =inventory= to Bucket to get a list of what Bucket contains.

*** Adding new items to inventory
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: adding-new-items-to-inventory
    :END:

You can give Bucket new items by making a message that follows the basic
patterns outlined below. (Replacing ={item}= with the object you wish to
give to Bucket.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/me puts {item} in Bucket.
/me gives Bucket {item}
/me gives {item} to Bucket
#+END_EXAMPLE

Bucket will ignore your attempt to keep an item in him if the line
ends with a question mark.  Bucket will also ignore your attempt to
keep an item in him if the message contains the word =to=.

Bucket will replace the word =his= or =her= with ={nick}'s=, with
={nick}= being the nick of the person giving him the item. Example:
=/me gives Bucket his banana= would add =<nick>' banana= to Bucket's
inventory. Bucket will not accept duplicate items.

*** Deleting inventory items
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: deleting-inventory-items
    :END:

Ops can delete items from the inventory (which will also stop them from
ever being automatically created) using the =detailed inventory= and
=delete item #X= commands.

*** Inventory variables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: inventory-variables
    :END:

**** $item
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: item
     :END:

=$item= will be replaced by a randomly selected item from Bucket's
inventory.

**** $giveitem
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: giveitem
     :END:

=$giveitem= will be replaced by a randomly selected item from Bucket's
inventory and will discard the item.

-  :: Use sparingly.Creating a factoid that discards many items will
  make a fury of ten thousand toilet rolls descend upon you.

**** $newitem
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: newitem
     :END:

=$newitem= will be replaced by a randomly selected item from a list of
various items Bucket has accumulated over time and will then add the
item to his current inventory.

** Gender
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: gender
   :END:

Bucket now has support for genders. 
More specifically, you will be able to tell Bucket by which pronoun you
would like to be referred to.

*** Grammatical genders
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: grammatical-genders
    :END:

This is a table of the five types of genders that you can choose and
what pronouns are associated with them:

| Grammatical Gender | Subjective | Objective | Reflexive | Possessive Pronoun | Possessive Determiner |
|--------------------+------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------+-----------------------|
| Male               | he         | him       | himself   | his                | his                   |
| Female             | she        | her       | herself   | hers               | her                   |
| Androgynous        | they       | them      | themself  | theirs             | their                 |
| Inanimate          | it         | it        | itself    | its                | its                   |
| Full name          | <name>     | <name>    | <name>    | <name>'s           | <name>                |

- The male set of pronouns uses the traditionally male pronouns, "he",
  "him" and "himself".
- The female set of pronouns uses the traditionally female pronouns,
  "she", "her" and "herself".
- The androgynous set of pronouns uses the gender neutral singular they,
  "they", "them" and "themself".
- The inanimate set of pronouns uses the gender neutral "it", often used
  on inanimate objects, "it" "its" and "itself".
- The Full name set of..."pronouns" simply uses the user's name.

*** Setting and looking up genders
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: setting-and-looking-up-genders
    :END:

You can set your own gender by addressing =I am {gender}= to Bucket,
replacing ={gender}= with the gender of your choice.

You can ask what is the gender of another user by asking =what gender
is {username}=.

*** Gender Variables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: gender-variables
    :END:

The following variables can be used in factoids, and will use the
correct pronoun if a factoid contains =$someone= or =$who=.

|            | Subjective                                           | Objective                                         | Reflexive                                                                              | Possessive Pronoun                                | Possessive Determiner                   |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Variable   | $subjective, $shehe, $heshe, $he, $she, $they, $it   | $objective, $him, $her, $them, $himher, $herhim   | $reflexive, $himselfherself, $herselfhimself, $himself, $herself, $themself, $itself   | $possessive, $hishers, $hershis, $hers, $theirs   | $determiner, $hisher, $herhis, $their   |

** Special Factoids
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: special-factoids
   :END:

There are a few factoids that are used to generate replies to specific
situations:

- =Don't know= :: Called when a factoid is requested that has no values.
  These responses are taught by the channel ops. (I don't know anything
  about that.)
- =Band name reply= :: Called randomly when someone uses a short phrase
  that sounds like a band name (=<reply> "$band" would be a good name for  a band.=)
- =Tumblr name reply= :: Called randomly when someone uses a short phrase
  that sounds like a tumblr name (=<reply> [[http://$band.tumblr.com]]=).
  Sometimes the tumblr name is so awesome that a
  [[file:Denizens][denizen]] creates it. A list of Bucket-created
  tumblrs can be found [[file:tumblr][here]].
- =Duplicate item= :: Called when someone puts an item that is already in
  the inventory (=<reply> $who: I already have $item.=)
- =Drops item= :: Called when an item drop is forced (=<action> fumbles and drops $giveitem.=)
- =Pickup full= :: Called when an item is handed to a user, but (s)he has
  already been given something (=<action> hands $who $giveitem for $item=)
- =Takes item= :: Called when an item is taken (=<action> is now carrying $item.=)
- =List items= :: Called when someone asks for Bucket's inventory (uses
  variable $inventory)
- =Uses reply= :: Called when someone says =uses <XYZ>=
- =Automatic Haiku= :: Called when a haiku is detected

** Special Functions (non-factoids)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: special-functions-non-factoids
   :END:

- =10+2= :: Bucket can do basic math (=+,-,*,/,**=). For that to work he
  needs to be addressed, the line may only contain numbers and the
  aforementioned operations and there must not be a factoid for it (as
  example, =1+1= has its own factoids).
- =bad-ass= :: If a message contains a phrase similar to =$adjective-ass $noun= (like bad-ass car), Bucket will shift the hyphen. See also
  [[http://xkcd.com/37/][Hyphen]]
- =Do you know?= :: If a message starts with the phrase "do you know",
  Bucket will respond with "No, but if you hum a few bars I can fake it.
- =Say it again= :: If anybody says a line that starts with "say" and
  Bucket is not being addressed, Bucket will repeat everything after say
  followed by an exclamation mark.
- sexchange :: If a message contains a word starting with ex, there's a
  random chance Bucket will repeat the phrase, substituting ex with sex
- super effective! :: If anybody says a line (or performs an action)
  that starts with "uses", Bucket may respond with "It's super
  effective!"
- TLA :: A three letter acronym without any punctuation will cause
  Bucket to respond with a potential meaning of the three letter
  acronym, even when not addressed. The meanings are phrases Bucket
  considers good band names.
- the fucking :: If a message contains the phrase "the fucking", Bucket
  will swap both words


** Filling silence
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: filling-silence
   :END:

If nobody has said anything in a while (about three minutes), Bucket
will sometimes quote something from one of the following websites:

- [[http://mylifeisaverage.com/][MyLifeIsAverage]]
- [[http://twitter.com/Shitmydadsays][Shit My Dad Says (Twitter)]]
- [[http://twitter.com/FakeAPStylebook][Fake AP Stylebook (Twitter)]]
- [[http://twitter.com/FakeAnimalFacts][Fake Animal Facts (Twitter)]]
- [[http://twitter.com/God_Damn_Batman][God Damn Batman (Twitter)]]

If Bucket doesn't quote one of the websites, he displays a random
factoid.

** Sourcecode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sourcecode
   :END:

This version of Bucket has been in channel since January 21, 2009.
Bucket's sourcecode is available on
[[https://github.com/zigdon/xkcd-Bucket/tree/master][github]]. He's
written in perl, by the way.

** Variable editing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: variable-editing
   :END:

Some variables can be edited.

*** Editable variables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: editable-variables
    :END:

All editable variables are currently protected, which means they
cannot be edited by normal users.

Parts of speech

*** Listing editable variables
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: listing-editable-variables
     :END:

Address =list vars= to Bucket to get a list of known variables that are
editable.

*** Listing the values in a variable
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: listing-the-values-in-a-variable
     :END:

You can get all the values in a variable by using =list var {variable}=
with ={variable}= being replaced by the variable you wish to see.

-  :: Bucket will display a link to the list of variables if there are
  too many variables to list. (Similar to =literal[*]=)

*** Adding to a variable
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: adding-to-a-variable
     :END:

Addressing =add value {variable} {value}= (replace ={variable}= with the
variable you wish to add to and replace ={value}= with the thing you
wish to add to the variable) to Bucket will add a value to that
variable.

*** Removing from a variable
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: removing-from-a-variable
     :END:

=remove value {variable} {value}= (again, replace ={variable}= with the
variable you wish to remove from and replace ={value}= with the thing
you wish to remove from the variable).


*** Setting a variable type
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: setting-a-variable-type
     :END:

=var {variable} type {var|verb|noun}= Sets the "type" of a variable.
Verb type variables can accept a "-ing" and "-ed" and "-s" suffix, while
noun types can accept "-s" and update the "a/an" prefix. You can see
whether a variable what type a variable is by using "list vars" and
checking if there is a "(n)" for noun-types or a "(v)" for verb-types
behind the variable.

** User Commands
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: user-commands
   :END:

*** Adding factoids

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  X is Y
  X are Y (plural)
  X <reply> Y
  X <action> Y
  X <<verb>> Y
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =<verb>= is some verb, for example: =X <drinks> Y=.
It lets you use a verb that isn't "is" or "are"!

*** Listings

- =literal X= gives the first few factoids for X
- =literal[#] X= pages through the next factoids for X
- =literal[*] X= dump out all the factoids for X to a URL
- =list items= or =inventory= lists out the current inventory.

*** Select

Pick a factoid at random from the factoids of =X= that includes
=phrase=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  X =~ /phrase/
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Edit

Bucket will replace the first instance of =a=
it finds with =b= in the factoid called =X=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  X =~ s/a/b/
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or, =undo last= will undo the last modification made (only works if it
was done by the same user who calls undo)

*** Keywords

- =$who= :: when a factoid is triggered, all instances of this keyword
  will be substituted for by the nick of whomever triggers the factoid.
- =$someone= :: replaces with the nick of a random person who may or may
  not be in channel at the time.
- =$item= :: replaces with a random item in his inventory.
- =$giveitem= :: replaces with a random item in his inventory, and deletes
  that item.

*** Commands

- =shut up= :: stop talking in channel for one minute.
- =stats= :: Give some numbers on what Bucket knows and has
  learned. The totals update every 10 minutes or so.
- =something random= :: Show a random factoid.
- =what was that?= :: will respond with the factoid related to the
  last tidbit uttered.
- =list vars= :: show all the defined variables
- =list var {variable}= :: show all the values of a variable (or

- =add value {variable} {value}= :: add a new value to the already
  defined variable (only if it's unprotected)
- =remove value {var} {value}= :: remove value <value> from
  variable (only if it's unprotected)
- =remember {nick} {snippet}= :: Look in the last few lines in channel
     for a line containing the partial line mentioned. If found, add
     it to a =nick quotes= factoid in the form of =<{nick}> {line that
     was found}=. The number of lines remembered per channel is
     controlled by the =history_size= parameter.
- =I am {gender}= :: Tell bucket what gender he should use to
  refer to you. See the gender docs for complete details.
- =what is my gender?= :: Ask bucket to report your gender.
- =restore topic= :: Ask Bucket to restore the previous topic in
  the current channel, if possible.
